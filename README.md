Idea of updates (dont learn these cards now...)

i'm new on GitHub.i have a idea of updates for you... pls change that...
sorry i d'ont speak very nicely english

we can in the browsing cards say don't want learn this cards actually...(when we set in
yellow the cards) but we c'ant do that when we see this card in deck playing mode
...so pls add a button in deck playing for dont learn this card actually and
a 2nd buttom for don't see new card in this deck (on/off)
